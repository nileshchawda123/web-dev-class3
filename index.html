        <p>India batting maestro Kohli talked about playing in the USA and said he never thought that he would be playing in the States
            The stage is set for the T20 World Cup 2024 as the USA is all set to co-host the tournament alongside the West Indies. The mega ICC event is going to be extremely crucial to create massive awareness about the sport in the USA where basketball and baseball are enjoyed by a wider audience. Big players like Virat Kohli will also play a big role in promoting the game in the states as cricket will also be part of the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028.

            “Honestly, I never thought we would be playing cricket in any form in the States. But now it’s a reality. And that tells you about the growing impact of the sport in the world and the United States is more than willing to accept the change and be probably the first ones on a global scale to accept it, in a way, with the World Cup," Kohli said in a video message.

        <p>There is no respite from the scorching heatwave sweeping several parts of India this summer, resulting in fatalities in Bihar, Jharkhand and Odisha.

            The national capital is grappling with an acute water shortage with residents forced to run after water tankers with their empty buckets. The city government has already moved the Supreme Court seeking additional supply from neighbouring states.
            
            The heatwave conditions have swept the country at a time when the Lok Sabha elections are in its last stage, with the final phase of voting slated to take place on Saturday.</p>
         <h1>Mr and Mrs Mahi review: Rajkummar Rao, Janhvi Kapoor throw a no ball despite a perfect partnership</h1>
         <img src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2024/05/31/550x309/Mr_and_Mrs_Mahi_review_1717149601834_1717149602046.png">
         <p>Mr and Mrs Mahi review: Rajkummar Rao and Janhvi Kapoor's movie lacks depth despite strong performances by lead pair.
            Sports films in Bollywood have mostly relied on the same tried and tested tropes that invite thunderous applause in a packed stadium when the protagonist beats all odds to emerge victorious. Barring Sushant Singh Rajput-starrer Chhichhore which didn't belong to the 'happy ending' herd, most sports dramas — right from Lagaan, Chak De! India to most recent Maidaan — have shown the underdog stories. Safe bet, isn't it? Director Sharan Sharma's romantic sports drama, Mr and Mrs Mahi is no different.

            Mr and Mrs Mahi review: Rakummar Rao and Janhvi Kapoor team up again after Roohi.
            Mr and Mrs Mahi review: Rakummar Rao and Janhvi Kapoor team up again after Roohi.
            The film struggles to stay afloat with an inconsistent pace and a storyline that's way too predictable to generate any curiosity. What works, however, is its lead pair Rajkummar Rao and Janhvi Kapoor's partnership that barely saves an almost-lost game. But beyond that, I really can't put my finger on anything that has stayed with me for long and made me stand up and take notice. For a sports film, that too on cricket, Mr and Mrs Mahi lacks adrenaline, and its pacing issues only worsen it.

            The plot
            The story revolves around Mahendra (Rajkummar Rao) and Mahima (Janhvi Kapoor) aka Mr and Mrs Mahi, who not only share the same nicknames, but also a deep love for cricket, so much so that on their wedding night, they are sitting on the sofa watching an India-Australia match. It reaches a point that MBBS topper Mahima leaves her hospital job, and starts chasing her childhood dream of hitting the red ball in the stands. Mahendra, on the other hand, tried his to excel on the pitch, but ends up as a failed cricketer. He rekindles his passion by turning coach for his wife and honing her raw skills. But this is Bollywood and a story set in Rajasthan, India, where men aren't really conditioned to live with a more successful wife getting all the spotlight and enjoying a 'star status'. This sense of insecurity, jealously and betrayal make this madly-in-love-for-cricket couple realise their shortcomings, mistakes and achievements, serving us a drama that rides high on emotions yet leaves you unsatisfied with its half-baked execution.
